<br>
:bangbang:  very early development 
#### i am currently learning svelte to built a better [frec](https://github.com//ayamkv/frec) linktree type of app that can be customizable
it will be called <b> [linko](https://github.com/ayamkv/linko)</b>


## what works
- **directus cms**, by fetching the public api (no auth) 
- css layout all done, just need some little tweaks

## todo
- custom admin page ``/admin``
- followed by **CRUD** _create, read, update, delete_ ( i have to learn directus sdk ðŸ™‚ help )
