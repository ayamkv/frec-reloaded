![svelte](https://img.shields.io/badge/SvelteKit-FF3E00?style=for-the-badge&logo=Svelte&logoColor=white)
<br>
very early development 
#### i am currently learning svelte to built a better [frec](https://github.com//ayamkv/frec) linktree type of app that can be customizable
it will be called <b> still looking for a better name</b>

## demo sites
- [vercel](https://raharja.vercel.app)
- ~~[netlify](https://raharja.netlify.app)~~ 



## what works 
- **directus cms**, by fetching the public api (no auth) 
> using no auth because fetching the data manually is much faster than using the [directus js sdk](https://docs.directus.io/reference/sdk.html).
although **we still need** to use the [sdk](https://docs.directus.io/reference/sdk.html) for updating clicks

- clicks stats on ``/stats``


## todo
- custom admin page ``/admin`` 
â€¢ with WYSIWYG **CRUD** 

> maybe or will move ``/stats`` to ``/admin``
>
> â€¢ **WYSIWYG** : What You See Is What You Get
>
> â€¢ **CRUD** : Create, Read, Update, Delete


> i have to learn directus sdk ðŸ™‚ help. 
**edit : it's actually challenging ~~fun~~
